This is the repository for the Git Cafe website, created by Group 8 during the Full Stack Developer course at Medieinstitutet. 

## Description

Git Cafe is a simple website developed using HTML and CSS. It serves as our group's first assignment for the FSU23D course. The website showcases our collaborative efforts and skills in front-end web development.
